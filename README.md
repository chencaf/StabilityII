# StabilityII

##Introduction

Here we hypothesise that species differences in life history strategy underlie the positive relationship between diversity and the stability of aboveground production. We predict that communities comprised of slow/conservative species will be resistant in the face of environmental fluctuations due to their low physiological process rates and their effective retention of water, carbon and nutrients. In contrast, we predict that the productivity of communities comprised of fast/exploitative species is more resilient as their faster growth and turnover rates allows them to recover quickly, exploit the pulses of resources that occur following perturbations but also lose tissue more rapidly during the periods that follow resource amendment. 

As the temporal stability of production (1/CV) emerges from the combination of both resistance and resilience, we therefore also hypothesise that functionally diverse communities, which contain both fast and slow strategy species, have the capacity to demonstrate both resistance and resilience, thus reducing overall variability across time. Although the fast-slow spectrum is a key axis of plant trait variation (Grime 1979, Wright et al 2004, Craine 2009, Reich 2014), it cannot capture all of the possible mechanisms via which plant traits may affect stability. There is evidence for a range of other trait-based mechanisms via which diversity may confer stability, e.g. recovery strategies, such as persistent seedbanks (refs), regrowth from belowground storage organs (Hoover et al 2014) may confer resilience, while others may allow resistance e.g. diverse communities dilute the effects of specialist pathogens making their overall biomass less susceptible to pathogen outbreaks (Eisenhauer et al. 2012, Rottstock et al. 2014). However, the importance of these mechanisms relative to those related to the fast-slow spectrum has not been investigated across a range of ecosystems.To address this gap we investigated the potential importance of fast and slow growth strategies, and their functional diversity in driving diversity-stability relationships using a comprehensive dataset of grassland biodiversity manipulation experiments, whilst also accounting for other unmeasured trait variation that may explain the diversity-stability relationship by using measures of phylogenetic diversity (Cadotte et al. 2008). 

##Methods

###Data

We used a subset of the datasets from Isbell et al. 2015 comprised of those where species-level biomass data was available.

The plot- and species-level data is largely the same as that used in Isbell et al. (2015), the differences being due to the availability of plot-level species biomass data. Further, we added data from two more studies (included in Craven et al. 2016).

With regards to functional traits, we obtained data from data contributors and TRY. For SLA, LDMC,  
and foliar N content, we now have data for > 95 % of species included across studies. Coverage for leaf P was  
slightly lower (~ 89%).  Functional diversity indices and community-weighted means were  
subsequently calculated using this data.    

Trait data was cleaned in the following manner (adapted from the 'Manning protocol'):    
  
1) species' names were scrubbed using [TNRS](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ci/tnrs)   

2) trait values were converted to the same units  

3) outliers were excluded following the protocol suggested by TRY (ErrorrRisk >4)  

4) trait values were first averaged by contributor before being calculated across all contributors.  

To represent functional complementarity, we calculated abundance-weighted functional dispersion (Legendre and Laliberte 2010) using SLA, LDMC, and leaf N and P.

Phylogenetic data was compiled and a phylogenetic tree was built using Phylogenerator (Pearse and Purvis 2013).
